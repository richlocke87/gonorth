Most but not all have dusty labels with incomprehensible things scrawled on them. Another wall is hidden behind rows and rows of leather-bound books.\n\nOn the cold flagstones under foot there's a pentagram smeared in something brown and old-looking. Behind that there's a wooden bureau strewn with yellowing bits of paper.\n\nThere's a red door to the west."
